# Data-Analysis-Visualization---Cost-of-Heart-Attack-Procedure
In this project, I analyzed the cost of a heart attack procedure and what other variables influence the cost.
This repository contains the Rmd file, the knitted HTML file and the hospitals data set
The hospitals data set I used was obtained from The Centers for Medicaire & Medicaid Services
